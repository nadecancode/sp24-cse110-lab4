For the answer below, if it's just a simple value then it implies the value is being printed during function call. If I put an error then it means such error happened during function call, if question asked what the function returns then that value will be the value that function returned.

1. `values added:  20`
2. `final result:  20`
3. `values added:  20`
4. `ReferenceError: result is not defined`, this is because line 13 tries to access the `let` variable `result` outside of its defined block scope.
5. `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`, this is because line 7 tries to change the value of `const` variable `result` to a different value, which violates the constraint of `const` declaration.
6. Nothing, since line 7 throws an error line 13 would not be executed. If you're strictly asking about what will get printed as a program, then it'd be same as question 5, which is `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`
